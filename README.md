# GrowCube Home Assistant Custom Component

This is a very early version of a Home Assistant integration for the Elecrow GrowCube smart plant watering system.

## Warning

This is still at the _works on my machine_ stage while I understand how it all fits together. Probably doesn't comply with Home Assistant best practices so I can't guarantee there won't be any weird behaviour.

The integration doesn't store any persistent state or change any other aspects of HA. If you do get into trouble, just remove any GrowCube devices you added and there should be no traces left behind.

## Usage

The custom component is installed using [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/)
